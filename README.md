Contents of my order was as I expected (score 1-5) 
I paid a good price for my order (score 1-5) 
etc

## Objective
The goal of this project is to conduct sentiment analysis based on customer reviews. 

## Models

Logistic regression and decision trees were used to make predictions.
Feature extraction was performed to determine which questions were most relevant to determine customer satisfaction.
